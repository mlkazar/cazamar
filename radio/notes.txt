play station, go to "view source" in Mozilla, search for
"shoutcast_stream" and next is the http address of the stream

http://c11icyelb.prod.playlists.ihrhls.com/1097_icy

is an example.  Note the 4 digit code.

You can get a little more info about the station by going to
http://iheart.com/live/<number> and when you get a 301, the location
header gives the real URL, which will be something like
/live/kiss-108-1097, i.e. tells you it is Kiss 108.  The <title> line
under <head> will give a better description (Boston's Hit Radio Station).
