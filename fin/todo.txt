* Have 'gain' compute average balance for each fund over the course of
the selected period.  Then use that to estimate annualized dividend
return

Lookup per-fund dividend rate, and use that for forward looking
divident income estimates. ticker.info["yield"] or ["dividendYield"]
The former is a fraction and the latter is a percentage.

Doesn't seem to be treating IRA returns as IRA values.  Maybe just
treating as regular dividends is sufficient?  But not for cap gains
distributions or qualified divs, all of which will really be taxed as income.

Figure out what to do about tax lot information.  Maybe new command
that displays funds, the total amount of losses harvestable, and total
gains under x%.
