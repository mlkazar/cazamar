				Intro

Maintain separate set of directories with references to object IDs to
other dirs and files, so that we can handle renames.  Note that moving
objects between directories doesn't seem to work in cloud (looks like
it copies the tree).  Renaming without moving a directory, OTOH, seems
to do just that, without a copy.

				Design

We maintain a tree of our own CFSX directories.  A CFSX dir contains a
collection of names and corresponding object IDs (not paths, but the
IDs that both Google and MS assign to objects).  The names are stored
as UTF8 strings, so we don't have to worry about the litany of file
names that are illegal in various cloud drive systems.
