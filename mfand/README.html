<h1>Kite Instructions</h1>

1 -- Drag and drop the Kite.app icon onto the Applications link icon.
<p><p>
2 -- Open the Kite application (from /Applications/Kite.app)
<p><p>
3 -- Use the Settings/Setup drop down to get a browser page to the app.
<p><p>
4 -- Click on the "Login to MS" item to login to your MS Office
365 account (* create one first).
<p><p>
Click on "Start/resume backup".
<p><p>
5 -- Go to your System Preferences application (an option under the Apple
logo), and go to the Energy Saver pane.  Select the "Power Adapter"
tab, and turn *on* "Prevent computer from sleeping...." and turn *off*
"Enable Power Nap...."  You can leave the options under Battery alone,
since you shouldn't be running Kite for hours with just the battery.
<p><p>
If you don't make these changes to your Energy Saver preferences, the
backup will pause when you walk away from your computer.
<p><p>
*: Kids -- go to login.live.com or office65.com (from a private
browsing window if you can't get it to log out properly), and click on
"Sign in" on the top right.  If you have an account, great, otherwise
click on "Create One!"  Once you have an account your Office Home
admin (Dad) can add your account (don't buy Office, I already did).
