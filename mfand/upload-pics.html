<h1>Giving Kite Access to Photos</h1>

1 -- Go to your System Preferences application (an option under the
Apple logo), and under "Security & Privacy", go to the "Privacy" tab,
and select "Full Disk Access" on the left pane.  Then use the finder
to drag the Kite.app (from Applications) into the pane on the right.
This gives Kite.app permission to read your Pictures.  You may have to click on the lock
icon to make changes.
<p>
2 -- If you didn't do the other things in the install disk's README
file, now would be a good time to do them, as well :-)
