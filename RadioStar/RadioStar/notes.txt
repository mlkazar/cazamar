Ideas for Radio app

1 record multiple streams

2 record based on schedule (like alarm setting code)

3 back and skip buttons

4 save recordings.  some UI to select true start and end of song.

========Todo========

** bullet proof playing code

-- make sure multi-word queries are properly escaped ('\020' or '+') in
HTTP queries in RadioScan.

-- +20 / -20 buttons

-- Automatically figure out if browing or searching for a single
station (pretty much always browse, but watching try treating as a
name as well)

-- clearer done and cancel buttons during search

-- some way to see which station is playing.

-- trim saved music stream after N minutes

-- incremental image population for search bar and main screen

-- save history per station (or globally).  The latter is probably better.

** current song needs to be represented in file data stream.

-- basic record button.  When recording, don't shutdown stream.
   Indicate visually.

Longer term items

-- alarm clock functionality?

-- Some way when saving a recording to edit the start and end times.

-- smart record functionality -- by song boundary

-- export recordings somehow

-- use backing file for large streams
