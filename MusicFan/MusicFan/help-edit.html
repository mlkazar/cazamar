    <h1>Channel Sources</h1>
    <p>
      This screen shows all of the sources for your audio channel.  Sources can be removed
      by swiping left on the source and selecting the exposed "Delete" button.  The "Clear All"
      button removes all sources.

      Pressing the "+UPNP" button lets you configure your UPNP / DLNA servers.  If you
      intend to play or download music from your UPNP / DLNA servers, you must configure the
      servers first, which loads the music names and locations into the AudioGalaxy library.
      Afterwards, you can simply add music from UPNP sources from the Source menus.
    </p>
    <p>

      When adding a music item, you can select a minimum star rating
      filter.  You can also press the "Cloud" button to include media
      items from your iTunes library cloud, but not present on your
      iPhone.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you press the information button "Circle-i", instead
      of selecting that playlist, artist or album, AudioGalaxy will zoom into
      a new selection screen showing only the songs in that group.  You can
      then select specific items from that group.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can remove a media entry by swiping the entry left, and
      pressing the exposed DELETE button.
    </p>
    <h2>Podcasts / RSS Feeds</h2>
    <p>
      After adding Podcasts media groups to a channel, you must select
      specific podcasts to download in the Song List screen.
      Red-tinted podcasts haven't been loaded, while green tinted ones
      have.  Swipe left on a podcast to load or unload a podcast, or
      to see the detailed description of the podcast.  When playing
      podcasts, the player will move from one downloaded podcast to
      the next, ignoring unloaded podcasts.
