    <h1>Configuring UPNP / DLNA Servers</h1>
    <p>
      AudioGalaxy can stream music from your local DLNA / UPNP
      servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add music from a UPNP/DLNA server, press "Find Servers" to
      browse for music servers (you may have to browse multiple times
      to find all servers on your LAN, since UPNP uses the unreliable
      multicast UDP protocol for device discovery).
    </p>
    <p>
      You likely need to enable the UPNP (sometimes called DLNA)
      service on your Router or NAS appliance before browsing for
      servers will work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once server discovery is complete, decide which servers you want
      to load music from, and then select each server one at a time,
      and press "Load From Selected" to read the music directories and
      cover art from that server.  Once the music directories have
      been loaded, music from the servers can be added through the
      usual Sources button.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can redo the "Find Servers" operation to find new servers at
      any time, and you can redo the "Load From Selected" operation to
      discover newly added music on the server.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can swipe left on the list of UPNP devices, and remove any
      servers, as well as the music loaded from those servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a music directory has been loaded, you do not have to
      reload it except to pick up new music from the server.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you have defined a channel including music from a UPNP
      server, you can swipe left on individual songs in the channel
      list to download those songs for offline listening.  You can
      also press "Load All" on the "Song List" screen to download all
      UPNP-resident music in the channel.  If a song isn't downloaded
      and your NAS system is not available on your current network,
      you won't be able to play that song (surprise).
