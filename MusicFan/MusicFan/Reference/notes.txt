Description:
====
Easily create multiple on-the-fly channels (playlists). 

Switch among podcasts, Internet radio stations, and your music with the press of a button!

AudioGalaxy saves your place in each channel, so you go back to where you left off the next time you switch back to that channel.

Each channel consists of a mix of your choice of playlists, albums, artists, songs, radio stations or podcasts, each qualified by an optional minimum rating.

Podcasts are downloaded directly from RSS feeds, avoiding iTunes.

Lite version has same functionality as full version now!

We want to hear from you!  Please send comments or suggestions to djtogoapp@gmail.com.
