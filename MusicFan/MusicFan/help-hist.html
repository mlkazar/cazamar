    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      AudioGalaxy can records the music you've played from Internet
      Radio, along with the time it was heard.  So, if you hear
      something cool, you can go back and find out the song or artist
      you heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can clear the history, if you'd like.  And only the last 1000 entries are kept,
      so you don't have to worry about using unlimited memory on your telephone*.
