/* The MFANAqPlayer is a multi-stage pipeline to play music from an
 * HTTP stream, with a simple external interface.
 *
 * The init function initializes the object.
 *
 * The play: function starts playing a stream, given a URL.  It uses
 * the radiostream module to handle indirection through playlists and
 * other random junk that people put in radiostation URLs.
 *
 * The pause function pauses the player, whose resume function can
 * restart the player where it left off.
 *
 * The resume function resumes a paused player.
 *
 * The stop function stops the player in a way that it can't be
 * restarted, but can of course be released.
 *
 * The setStateCallback and setSongCallback set callbacks for state
 * changes and new song indications (from those stations that provide
 * icecast information).
 *
 * The getSongIndex function returns which song we're playing.
 *
 * The getCurrentPlaying function returns a string with the contents
 * of the last song indicated, for icecast strings, and otherwise
 * returns a canned "[Unknown]" string.
 *
 * The static MFANSAqPlayer_getUnknownString returns the contents of
 * the aforementioned canned string, so our caller can tell whether we
 * really know the song, by comparing the indicated song with this
 * string.
 *
 * It handles streams consisting of MP3 or AAC data; it doesn't handle
 * ASX data today because I don't *think* that the Audio player can
 * handle that type of data.
 *
 *================================================================
 *
 * The data path is the play function queues a URL for an async
 * pthread, which calls RadioStream::init to start loading the URL.
 * Two callbacks are registered, one for song changes (control), and
 * one for streamed music data.  The class handles play list and other
 * forms of redirection, and also understands icecast format streams,
 * which come with embedded stream labels.
 *
 * Once data arrives from the radiostream module (via rsDataProc), we
 * open an AudioFileStream, which is a packet parser that understands
 * the stream data type that the stream's content type specifies.  The
 * HTTP headers have already been processed by the time the data
 * stream starts.
 *
 * The parser calls back to the PacketsProc and PropertyProc function,
 * and is supplied with data to parse by the radiostream's data proc's
 * calling AudioFileStreamParseBytes.  The parser then calls back to
 * the PropertyProc as soon as the stream is ready to play, at which
 * time the callback creates and creates an audio queue with
 * AudioQueueNewOutput.
 *
 * The PacketsProc callback is called with an integral number of audio
 * packets, and copies them into a buffer, which gets queued to the
 * player.  When the player finishes with the buffer, it calls back to
 * the handleOutput callback, returning the buffer, where we put it on
 * a free list until the next PacketsProc callback sends more data.
 *
 * Stopping this mess is sorta hard, since you'll crash if you free
 * everything while there are outstanding callbacks, and of course,
 * Apple doesn't really document how to shutdown an AudioStream.
 *
 * When our stop function is called, we stop the radiostream first,
 * but of course there may be outstanding upcalls of radiostream data.
 * If the stream gets closed, the rsDataProc will catch that on the
 * upcall and return.  If not closed at the start, it holds a
 * reference to the MFANAqPlayer so it doesn't get freed during the
 * upcalls it generates.  It returns as soon as it notices the closed
 * flag getting set.
 *
 * We can't detect if HandleOutput is called while we're trying to
 * shutdown, so we're just hoping that we won't get a pending upcall
 * after AudioQueueStop / AudioQueueDispose return to us, because
 * after that happens, our MFANAqPlayer may be free; I don't think
 * that the AudioQueue code is actually holding a reference to our
 * MFANAqPlayer.  This is an area where Apple simply doesn't document
 * a suitable protocol for a clean shutdown.
 *
 ================================================================
 *
 * The radiostream is initialized with a BufGen factory, which creates
 * TCP sockets to specified host/port pairs.  For iOS, we need to
 * provide a factory that generates MFANSocket structures, since
 * regular Berkeley sockets don't work on cellular networks (starting
 * in iOS 10.2, apparently).  MFANSockets have the same BufGen
 * interface as our buffered socket wrapped BufSocket, but are
 * implemented on top of CFStreams instead.
 *
 * Thanks Apple for making BSD sockets unusable, and doing so without
 * any warning.
