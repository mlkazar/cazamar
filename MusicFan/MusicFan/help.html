      The AudioGalaxy media player lets you create multiple on-the-fly channels,
      each matched to a radio button.  You then switch from one channel
      to another just by pressing the channel's button.  You can
      see the gold channel buttons at the bottom of the screen image below.
    </p>
    <p>
      AudioGalaxy remembers where you are in each channel, so you can
      resume playing any channel where you left off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Channels come in three types: music channels, podcast channels
      and radio channels.  Music channels contain collections of music
      by specific artists, music in specific albums, or specific
      songs.  Podcast channels contain selections from one or more
      podcasts, and are automatically sorted by date.  And radio
      channels contain one or more Internet radio stations, which can
      be switched between using the next and previous buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can define a new channel by selecting the metallic radio button from
      the bottom with which to associate the channel, and then either press the
      edit button at the top, if you're not changing the channel type, or select
      the main menu button and then press the appropriate "+Define <type> Channel"
      button for the type of channel you're defining.
    </p>
    <img src="help-main.png" width="240" border="2">
    <a id="Editing"><h2>Editing Channels</h2></a>
    <p>
      To program a channel, select the "Channel Details" button at the
      top left of the screen.  This brings up a list of the channels
      current contents.  Press the "Define" button on that screen, and
      AudioGalaxy will bring up the sources defining the channel.  To
      add a new Source, press "+" button within the Sources screen.
      To remove a source, swipe left to expose the "Delete" button.
    </p>
    <img src="help-edit.png" width="240" border="2">
    <p>
      In the screen above, the channel consists of all songs in the
      "Recently Added" iTunes playlist rated 4 stars and above, and
      which are present on the iPhone, combined with all the songs by
      the group "The Aislers Set" in the iTunes library, whether
      present on the phone or not, combined with all the songs by
      "Alvvays", again in the iTunes library, whether on the phone or
      not, finally combined with the album "Yoshi Battles The Hip-Hop
      Robots."  Once you press the Done button, you'll see the
      "Channel Contents" button again, and can press the "Randomize"
      button if you wish the songs to be played in random order.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one or more of the source entries were created in error, you
      can remove the entry by swiping left on the entry, and
      confirming with the exposed "Delete" button.  If you want to
      clear all entries and define this channel from scratch, you
      press the "Clear All" button.
    </p>
    <a id="Selecting"><h2>Selecting Items</h2></a>
    <p>
      Items are added to the channel's song list in the order in which
      you select them.  Once you have a channel defined, you can also
      change the order of play in the "Channel Contents" screen by
      dragging the items into the desired order.
    </p>
    <img src="help-sel.png" width="240" border="2">
    <a id="Zooming"><h2>Zooming In</h2></a>
    <p>
      If you press the details button (">"), instead of selecting that
      playlist, artist or album, you will zoom into a new selection
      screen showing only the songs in that group.  For example, if
      you press the ">" button after selecting the album "Another
      Green World", you'll bring up a sub-selection screen containing
      only songs from that album.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can select the specific songs you want to include; a check
      mark will appear by the selected songs.  When you press "Done"
      in a zoomed view, the selected items are added to the channel
      immediately, and you return to the previous selection screen.
    </p>
    <a id="Settings"><h2>Settings</h2></a>
    <p>
      The "Settings" menu is reached from the "Menu" icon at the top right of
      the main screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first item in the setting list forces the application to
      reload its choice tables from the iTunes library when the iTunes
      library changes.  You shouldn't need to press this, since the
      app should notice on its own when new items are present in the
      library, and reload its lists next time you edit a channel's
      definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next item in the settings list sets the default in the media
      selection screens for the Cloud setting.  If you typically want Cloud
      items included in your channel lists, press this setting to default
      the Cloud edit button to enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: if you enable playing cloud iTunes library items, you MUST
      enable the use of the cloud for playing music, as described
      below.  If you don't, AudioGalaxy will get skip the songs not
      present on your phone, and we'll all be unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On iOS 8.3 and before, go to Settings / Music and enable "Show All Music".
    </p>
    <p>
      On iOS 9 and later, go to Settings / Music and select "Show Apple Music," which
      seems to include your purchased Music, even if you're not using Apple Music.
      Also, if the option is present in your iOS version, enable "Cellular Data" on the
      same screen if you want to be able to stream music while outside of WiFi range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that to enable cellular music, you must turn on the
      "Cellular Data" setting above, and, in Settings / Cellular, turn
      on "Cellular Data" and make sure on the same screen that the
      switch enabling the app "AudioGalaxy" for cellular data is also
      turned on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next item in the settings controls whether anonymous usage
      information will be shared with the developers of AudioGalaxy.
      This information consists only of the type of media played
      (song, podcast, or radio station), and the time it is played, to
      help development prioritize features.  It defaults to "on."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next settings item tells whether all podcasts should
      automatically be downloaded.  It defaults to off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next setting button, when pressed, immediately unloads all
      downloaded podcasts from the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next setting button resets all per-screen warnings so that
      the user will see all the warnings again, until each is
      individually dismissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next setting button shows this application help; you probably knew that already.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next setting controls whether podcasts are unloaded after they finish playing.
      The default is not to automatically unload podcasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next setting button gets you to the UPnP configuration
      screen, described in its own section below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next setting controls whether the screen will dim after a
      minute of not being touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next setting gets you to the "History" page, which lets you
      see the history of music played by Internet radio stations that
      announce their songs via the Icecast metadata embedding
      protocol.
    </p>
    <a id="Podcasts"><h2>Podcasts</h2></a>
    <p>
      Podcasts are selected by pressing the "+Define Podcast channel"
      item from the main menu.  You search for podcasts, even though
      none of their names appear until you do a search.  The search
      brings up podcast shows, not individual episodes of those shows,
      so you will need to visit the Channel Contents screen load the
      specific podcast episodes you want to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only downloaded episodes can be played, so you will also need to
      specifically download the episodes you want to hear.  When
      playing a channel containing podcasts, the player will skip
      unloaded podcasts.  To download a podcast, swipe left on the
      episode, and press the exposed "DnLoad" button.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to save an episode of a podcast on your computer,
      you can swipe left on the episode and press the exposed "Export"
      button.  A copy of the podcast will be placed in the directory
      shared via iTunes, from which you can cop the file to your Apple
      desktop.  Exported episodes can be deleted from the "Manage
      Downloads" menu item or from iTunes itself.
    </p>
    <a id="Radio"><h2>Internet Radio</h2></a>
    <p>
      You can now add Internet radio stations to a channel.  Unlike
      all the other items, radio stations don't advance to the next
      item when done, since they're never done.  You can still put
      more than one station in a channel, but you have to switch
      manually between them using the "Channel Details" button, or by
      pressing the Next or Prev buttons on the main player.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that some radio stations may not play, although we've done
      our best to filter out dead stations or stations that only
      stream incompatible formats.  Radio stations typically may stop
      when you switch between Wifi and cell networks: the player
      should automatically resume within about 20 seconds of losing
      your Wifi signal.  There used to be a bug that prevented the
      player from restarting the channel, which required that you
      switch to a different radio station, and then back, to restart,
      and I'm leaving this description here just in case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Radio stations can be recorded by pressing the big red "Record"
      button while listening to a radio station.  Recording will stop
      if you change to another AudioGalaxy channel, or switch to
      another radio station in the same channel.  While recording, the
      button flashes red/orange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recordings are made from the Internet data stream, not through
      some hack like recording the sound via the microphone, so you
      don't have to worry about ambient noise affecting the recording.
      The recorded file type matches the type of data streamed, but
      QuickTime can be used to convert between AAC and MP3 file types.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recordings can be managed by going to the "Menu" button and
      selecting the "Manage Downloads" menu item.  You'll see exported
      podcasts and saved radio programs in the resulting screen, and
      if you swipe left, you'll see options to "Play" a recording,
      "Rename" the file to something more meaningful, or "Delete" the
      file.  Files in this directory are visible from iTunes, and
      iTunes can even add files to this directory.
    </p>
    <a id="RadioStations"><h3>Finding Radio Stations</h3></a>
    <p>
      AudioGalaxy comes preloaded with a set of Internet radio stations from
      http://radiosure.com/stations, after filtering out those whose streaming addresses
      don't seem to be responding.
    </p>
    <p>
      When adding radio stations to a channel, an "Add Custom" ("+")
      button is provided to add a radio station not in our database.
      This should be address of the HTTP transport stream itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many radio stations have a presence on streamtheworld.com.  The
      stream URLs have similar patterns, such as:<br><br>

      http://16893.live.streamtheworld.com/WYEPFMAAC.aac<br>
      http://17023.live.streamtheworld.com/WERSFMAAC.aac<br>
      http://16893.live.streamtheworld.com/WESAFM.mp3<br><br>

      That is, one of the canned hosts (16893.live.streamtheworld.com,
      17023.live.streamtheworld.com) followed by the station call letters, followed by an
      optional FM or AM, followed by an optional media type (MP3 or AAC), followed by
      a period (.) and then the media type again (mp3 or aac).
    </p>
    <p>
      Other numbers that might precede ".live.streamtheworld.com"
      include 16903, 13733, 16863, 16893, 18853, 17023, 16853, 17563,
      14213 18783, and 19013.  I have no idea how stations are
      assigned these numbers; you may have to guess.  If you type a
      valid stream URL into your browser title bar, however, you'll
      hear the station play, so you can test a guessed URL very easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't want to guess, you can often find the stream by
      starting the station playing from Safari, select "Show Page
      Resources" from "Develop", then click on "Network" and then
      double click on a resource with the call letters in the name.
      It will open a new tab on the exact web stream.
    </p>
    <a id="UPNP"><h2>UPNP/DLNA Music Servers</h2></a>
    <p>
      AudioGalaxy can stream music from your local DLNA / UPNP
      servers.  The process is a little involved: first you browse for
      the servers, then you load the names of the available songs into
      AudioGalaxy, and finally you select the desired songs from the
      channel definition screen, just like you'd add more music from
      your iTunes library, only using the "UPnp" buttons instead.  In
      more detail:
    </p>
    <p>
      To add music from a UPNP/DLNA server, press "Setup UPNP Music
      Servers" in the Main menu or the Settings menu.  Then press
      "Find Servers" to browse for music servers (you may have to
      browse multiple times to find all servers on your LAN), and then
      select one server at a time, and press "Load From Selected" to
      read the music directories from that server.  Once the music has
      been loaded, it can be added through the usual music channel
      definition button.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can redo the "Find Servers" operation to find new servers at
      any time, and you can redo the "Load From Selected" operation to
      discover newly added music on the server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a music directory has been loaded, you do not have to
      reload it except to pick up new music from the server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once UPNP music has been added to a channel, you can stream it
      immediately from your LAN, or you can go to the channel list,
      swipe left on any UPNP-resident song, and download it onto the
      phone for offline listening.
    </p>
